					Compartmentalization in eukaryotic cells is largely about efficiency. Separating the cell into different parts allows for the creation of specific microenvironments within a cell. That way, each organelle can have all the advantages it needs to perform to the best of its ability.

					Itâ€™s similar to the way that a home needs different environments in different rooms. You want a comfortable bed and curtains that block the sun in your bedroom, for instance, and you need appliances and food to be able to cook a meal in your kitchen. Outfitting each room of your house with all the resources necessary to perform every household duty would be a waste of time, money and space. Cells compartmentalize their resources in the same way your do in your home, allowing each part of the cell to flourish in its own tiny environment.

					In addition, several functions can be going on at once, also in the same way they do in a home. While you might be using your quiet basement to study, another family member could be using the garage to fix a car while someone else naps in the bedroom, all without disrupting each other. Since so many cellular reactions have to simultaneously happen to keep plant and animal life alive, it would be a serious inefficiency if each of your cells could not perform several jobs at once.

					Therefore, your eukaryotic cells have evolved to become super efficient spaces where multiple activities happen, allowing plant and animal life to thrive.
